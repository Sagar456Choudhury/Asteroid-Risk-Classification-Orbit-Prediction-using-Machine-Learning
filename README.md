# üåå Asteroid Risk Classification & Orbit Prediction Project
* This project combines machine learning and advanced data visualization to classify potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs), predict orbital paths, and analyze risk levels. Leveraging over 950,000 asteroid entries from NASA‚Äôs Small-Body Database, we aim to support the early detection and analysis of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs).

## üìÅ Project Overview
* Objective: Identify potentially hazardous asteroids, predict their orbits, detect anomalies in behavior, and analyze key risk factors based on orbital and physical characteristics.
* Dataset: 950,000+ asteroid records containing 45 features including physical parameters (diameter, albedo) and orbital properties (eccentricity, semi-major axis).
* Goals: 
  * Classify asteroids as hazardous or non-hazardous.
  * Predict asteroid size and orbital paths.
  * Detect anomalies in asteroid orbits and identify clusters of similar asteroids.
  * Visualize asteroid risk factors and trends.
